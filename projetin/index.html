    <h1>Florest</h1>

    <h2> Tuesday</h2>

     <p>Going through the forest is my favourite part of the walk. My dog Benji loves it too. I’m Grace. I live on a farm with my parents and I take Benji for a walk most days after school. While Benji’s playing, I stop to take a photo of a butterfly. I’m thinking about posting it on Facebook, but then I hear Benji barking. He’s jumping and running around a boy. The poor boy looks worried. 'Benji, stop! Come here!' I call and throw him his ball. I’m about to say sorry to the boy, but he’s gone.</p>

     

     

     <h2> Wednesday</h2>

<br>It’s cold today, so Benji and I are walking fast. As we go through the forest, it starts raining so I run. Suddenly, I fall and I’m on my back. OUCH! That hurt
<br>Then there’s someone there and a voice asks 'Are you all right?' I look up and see the boy from yesterday.</p>
   <br> 'I’m OK,' I say and the boy helps me up.
   <br> haven’t seen you at school. Do you live near here?' I ask.
   <br> No, I’m from Manchester,' he says. 'Sorry! I have to go. Can you walk? Do you need help?' 
   <br> 'No, I’m fine. Thanks!' I say and the boy walks away.
   <br> 'I’m Grace,' I call. 'What’s your name?' but he’s already gone.
